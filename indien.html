    <h2>India</h2>
    The plan is that this will become a travel diary from my trip to India, from the 7th of March to the 7th of April, 2014. Most of the entries are written in the evening, so they may not be very coherent or detailed.<br />
    A directory with all the images can be found <a href="./indien/">here</a>.<br />

    <h3>April 8<sup>th</sup>, 15.47:</h3>
    
    The last day in India was spent exploring parts of the city where we had never been. We started with lunch at Cafe Leopold and then took a taxi to Mahalaxmi to see a Hindu temple and a mosque, Haji Ali Dargah. After that we went to the nearby Chowpatty beach to get kulfi, an Indian ice cream. We had originally planned to walk around until we could get dinner, but when we had seen the things we planned to see in the area we decided to head back to the institute and have our last dinner there.<br />
    After dinner we took the worst taxi ride of the entire trip to the airport and started our 13 hour journey home.<br />
    Pictures from the last day are <a href="./indien/Day%2030/">here</a>.<br />

    <h3>April 5<sup>th</sup>, 23.16:</h3>
    
    As I said yesterday, today I went on a trip out of Mumbai with Jk. We took the ferry from Gateway of India to Mandwa port followed by a bus to Alibag, which is a city about 35 kilometres south of Mumbai (100 km if you are going by car). We did not originally have a plan for what we wanted to see, but we had considered a few nearby sights and decided that we would go for the local fort. It is located a kilometer from shore, which proved to be a bit of a problem. Since we could not see any way of getting there besides swimming (we later learned that you can walk there at low tide and otherwise you will need a boat) we had lunch and decided to see another fort that we had not found in our research of the city. When we got there, the two guards asked to take our photo and then communicated in broken English that the fort was now used as the local jail. They were not happy with us trying to take pictures, so we ended up just walking around the area and eventually took the bus and ferry back.<br />
    In the evening we went for thali at a place Niels had found on tripadvisor. Unfourtunately, google maps took us to the wrong area at first, so it took us nearly an hour and a half before we found the place. Luckily the food was great and very cheap, so the evening turned out alright after all.<br />
    Tomorrow night I will be leaving Mumbai, so there will be at most one update more once I get back home.<br />
    <a href="./indien/Day%2029/">Pictures</a>.<br />

    <h3>April 4<sup>th</sup>, 23.50:</h3>

    We are nearing the end of the trip. The last week has been the same schedule as I talked about before, staying at the institute for 9-10 hours and eating in the canteen. Today we broke the pattern by going to Woodside Inn for dinner, which is a bar modeled after an English pub. We had a burger and some local IPA and then we went to Starbucks for dessert.<br />
    The institute got a coffee machine yesterday, so we have actually been able to get drinkable coffee. The stuff they usually serve seems to be made by just boiling water with beans in and then filtering them out afterwards. It is pretty bitter with a bad aftertaste. However yesterday and today we have been buying both espresso and cappuccino for 10 and 20 rupees respectively (1 and 2 kr). To compare, the usual coffee costs 2 rupees for about the same amount, 6 rupees if you want milk.<br />
    Tomorrow the plan is to leave the city and travel by boat to the shore on the south side of the bay with Jk, to see something other than Mumbai before going home.<br />

    <h3>April 1<sup>st</sup>, 18.37:</h3>

    We are now back to the regular schedule of getting up, eating some kind of breakfast and staying at the institute all day. The breakfast at the guest house is the worst I have seen on this trip so far, with a small selection of the worst/most boring items from the other places we stayed and very little variation. Today we tried the canteen for breakfast instead and got a decent meal (some kind of snack mix with brown gravy and bread) so I think I will eat there for the rest of the stay. There are three canteens at TIFR named east, west and north. West is the one I prefer since it has proper plates and good food, but it is only open for breakfast and lunch. North is privately owned and slightly more expensive than east, but the food is generally of a higher quality. Both of them use metal trays, so eating there feels a bit like being in a prison. The food selection varies slightly, but all three use the same system with rice, two kinds of sauce, some vegetables and some meat. If you want meat, it costs the same as an entire vegetarian meal and it comes with plenty of bones. There is always some kind of bread and possibly a salad (often red onion based) as well.<br />

    <h3>March 30<sup>th</sup>, 13.30:</h3>
    
    I should update this thing again. The conference is over and we are back in Mumbai, now staying at the TIFR guesthouse. All in all it was an ok conference, but there was some miscommunication regarding the content of the talks. The talks from the centre were mostly at an introductory level with some simple examples, explaining the things people are working on and interested in studying. The talks from the Indians were mostly research level talks in algebraic geometry, which most of us did not understand.<br />
    The area near Kozhikode was in general much nicer than Mumbai, with palm trees and big houses. We went for a few walks in the area and I also went to an old Hindu temple in the city. They would not let us enter but we found a smaller temple nearby where we could walk around for a few minutes. It also turned out that Henning was placed at the other hotel, so I got to keep my suite for the entire stay.<br />
    We left Kerala Friday at 14.00, which in India means we boarded the plane at 14.20. When we arrived it was a cool 31 degrees, which was a nice change from the 37 in Calicut. The past two days have been spent mostly shopping and getting the last touristy things done, since some people are going home tonight. I have been to Dadar, which is a city district near the center of town with plenty of shops, people, cars and a market. We also managed to find a department store not too far away which sells western food.<br />

    <h3>March 23<sup>th</sup>, 22.36:</h3>

    As I am writing this, I am sitting in a hotel suite (only temporarily until Henning arrives) with the air condition on full, and it is still 28 degrees. We have arrived in Kozhikode (formerly Calicut) in Kerala today and it is 35 degrees outside. The hotel is really nice and as I said I have a temporary suite until more important people arrive, so I am enjoying it as much as I can. I am writing this from the sofa and considering moving to the small desk under the tv. I will attach some pictures below and probably include some of my new room when I get it so you can compare.<br />
    Two days ago, on Friday, we were joined in Mumbai by Troels and Dennis who arrived from Chennai. To celebrate we went to the Four Seasons hotel, or more specifically to the sky bar Aer, which has a view of the entire city. We stayed there for a few hours during happy hour and had some cocktails, before we moved on to another club nearby called Blue Frog to continue the party. It was almost empty when we arrived with a bit of music playing, so we ordered some food and a few beers. While we were waiting for the food a DJ took the stage and started playing techno. When our food arrived the place was packed and everybody was dancing.<br />
    As expected, most people were not up for sightseeing the next day, so we got some coffee and walked around town doing some shopping. We went to an Indian museum of history in the afternoon to be cultural and saw stuffed animals along with various types of art. In the evening we had dinner together, packed our things and had some beers at the hotel before we had to leave for Kerala.<br />
    Today we had breakfast at 8, paid for the hotel (due to problems with a bank transfer) and took the craziest cab ride of my life to the airport. We did not go below 60 km/h unless we had to wait in a queue. The plane ride was uneventful but the heat when we arrived was pretty tough. The Kerala School of Mathematics had arranged for a car to drive us to the hotel so we could check in and after a quick shower we drove into Kozhikode to look around. We walked along the beach and most people did not even try to hide the staring. It seems they do not get a lot of tourists here. When we got back to the hotel we met most of the other people from QGM going to the conference, including Jørgen. We had dinner (rice with two kinds of sauce, a bit like what we got in the canteen in Mumbai) and a few beers in the other suite, which Jørgen has claimed for himself, while talking about the trip and the coming conference.<br />

    <h3>March 20<sup>th</sup>, 22.14:</h3>
    
    Today was a quiet day. Together with Anders I went to the university at 8, which is a little earlier than usual. There was a talk on characteristic classes which I thought would be interesting, but like everything else at this conference it was mostly algebraic geometry. I also finished <a href="http://gabrielecirulli.github.io/2048/">2048</a> and signed up for the Young Topologist Meeting in Copenhagen, so I am pretty happy with my productivity. We were invited for another special dinner this evening (apparently it is usually held at a restaurant so when they held it at the guest house two days ago there was a lot of money left over) so we had some wine and talked to some of the locals and other guests at the conference.<br />
    As usual, there are a few <a href="./indien/Day%2013/">pictures.</a><br />

    I should probably update this thing. So as I mentioned in the last update, two days ago was the Holi festival. This is generally celebrated by throwing colours around and pulling pranks, but luckily people were very polite. We saw a few street vendors selling party-gear on the way to TIFR, but we were only approached by a single person who wished us a happy Holi and wanted to colour us. At the institute, things were pretty relaxed and we were told by our local guide that the festivities were happening over at the guest house, but only for a few hours. A couple of us went over to check it out but again people were friendly and asked us if we wanted colour before doing anything. This also led to the first selfies taken with the new camera. We finished the celebration in the evening at our local bar, Gokul.<br />
    A pre-conference also started this Monday at TIFR. Every day this week there will be 2 or 3 talks by various speakers, as well as snacks and water during the breaks. The talks so far have been of varying quality and relevance, but it is nice to get an occasional break from just sitting around. There are also special dinners, yesterday and tomorrow, which so far seems to consist of standing around and eating appetizers for one and a half hours before the food is served at 20.30.<br />
    We have also found a new place to sit, so we can avoid sitting quietly in the library. On the fourth floor there is a conference room, and when it is not being used for official business we can use it. We also have control of the air condition, so we do not have to wear sweaters all the time.<br />
    Today, we got up at 6.00 to go see flamingos. Our local friend showed us a beach, Sewri, where they come to eat algae and breed. There can be up to 25000 birds at a time, but there seemed to be fewer when we were there. We also arrived a bit after the sun had risen, so the birds had moved slightly away from the docks we were at and were hard to see.<br />

    <h3>March 16<sup>th</sup>, 21.47:</h3>
    
    Today was another quiet day. We went for coffee in the morning and walked around a bit without seeing anything new. When we got back to the hotel just after lunch, we were joined by Niels and JK who had just arrived. We went for cake at the same Starbucks we had gone to in the morning to hear about their flight and to get them used to the Indian weather. Most of us went out for dinner at a place near the hotel that serves Mediterranean food.<br />
    In other news, Anders and I have moved to a better hotel room. The old room had leaky pipes in the bathroom, so the air was constantly humid and terrible. Today they also removed part of the electrical circuit from the room while we were out, so we felt we had a reason to complain. Luckily the people in the reception just gave us a new room as soon as we said we were unhappy and we now have another room with a better bathroom, more room and nicer beds. Some pictures can be found <a href="./indien/Day%209/">here.</a><br />
    Tomorrow is the Holi festival, mostly known from the Sony commercial. This seems to consist of people throwing coloured powder and coloured water everywhere. I have no idea how good or bad it will be, but hopefully it will make for some nice pictures.<br />

We started by walking down <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colaba_Causeway">Colaba Causeway</a> and then went inside the Taj Mahal Palace Hotel. After that we went to Fashion Street to look at clothes, and we ended with a quick look in a local tea store.<br />
    In the evening we went to a seafood restaurant. The air was full of incense but the food was nice. We ended the evening with a movie at the hotel.<br />

Mostly we have been at the university from around 9 in the morning to 8 in the evening, eating lunch and dinner at the canteen and otherwise working in the library. The only interesting thing that has happened is that some of the others have gotten a bit sick, but it is nothing serious and they should hopefully be up and about again tomorrow. I have personally been fine, but we will see whether I get sick tomorrow.<br />

    Today Anders, Søren and I went on a trip to Elephanta Island. We met for breakfast at 7.30 and went towards the Gateway of India, an old monument on the docks of Mumbai built to welcome royalty and English officers. Now it serves as the starting point of commercial and tourist trips. From there we caught a ferry to Elephanta and climbed to the caves before the souvenir stands opened. At the caves we walked around, enjoying the view of the island, the temples in the caves and the monkeys running around. Søren had brought some bananas for a snack which we gave to the monkeys instead. They seemed to enjoy them. We also took a quick trip to Cannon Hill which had two old cannons and a nice view.<br />
    Due to the 30 degree weather we went back to Mumbai and had some lunch in an upscale touristy restaurant. The afternoon was spent at the hotel waiting for the weather to cool and catching up on sleep. When Kenneth and Jens-Jakob came back from their trip out of town, we went out for seafood at a nice restaurant the locals had recommended.<br />

    The following is a brief description of my first day in India, as well as the trip here.<br /><br />
    
    I met <a href="http://facebook.com/anders.d.jakobsen">Anders</a> at the train station in Århus at 1.30 the night between Friday and Saturday. Together we travelled to Kastrup, were we got some coffee
     and met <a href="http://pure.au.dk/portal/en/dtubben@qgm.au.dk">Daniel</a>. We caught our flight to Munich at 8.50, arrived at 10.40 and flew towards Mumbai at 11.20. The 8 hour flight was spent watching movies (Frozen is worth watching) and trying hard not to take a nap. We arrived at 23.55 local time to 26 degrees and general chaos. After a lengthy walk to get our luggage and a very brief visa inspection, we found a place where we could order a prepaid taxi to the hotel. At the hotel, we got our (not very impressive) room and a brief demonstration of the tv, then went to bed.<br />
    <br />
    The following morning we had breakfast at the hotel, mostly consisting of fruit, and met Arash who showed us to the institute where we will be working for the next month. The institute is located at the end of a road full of military bases. After we met Nitin Nitsure and got our temporary entry passes, we spent some time near the hotel finding places to buy bottled water and looking around. We returned for lunch at the institute and Daniel spent some time working while the rest of us sat around and tried not to fall asleep.<br />
    Around dinner time we met the people who were already here at the hotel and went out to a bar they had been to in the previous week for some beer and chicken tandoori.<br>
